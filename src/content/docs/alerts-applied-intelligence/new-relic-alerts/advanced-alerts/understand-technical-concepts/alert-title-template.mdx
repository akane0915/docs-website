An alert condition is the foundation for incident creation. Assigning a meaningful title to your alert condition ensures you can quickly pinpoint the source and specific parameters that triggered an incident. Whether you're using our guided mode or crafting a condition from a chart or policy, leverage our title template in the final step to customize incident titles for easy identification.

## Before you begin [#begin]

Here are some key things to note before you use our title template: 

* **Compatibility**: The title template feature is available for NRQL conditions only.
* **Character limit**: The maximum length for a title template is 256 characters.
* **Formatting**: The title template must follow a valid [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) format. 
* **Lost signal incidents**: For incidents triggered by a lost signal, the default title will always be used. To learn more about signal loss, see [Loss of signal and gap filling](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-loss-signal-gap-filling/). 

## Create a title [#example]

Let's say you've created an alert condition to trigger an incident when error rates spike in your `prod-us-123 entity`. You can use a title template to make incidents from this condition easily identifiable.

**Example**: 

```handlebars
{{conditionName}} targeting {{targetName}} incident
```

This template would generate the following incident title:

```
Error rate targeting prod-us-123 incident
```

## Use attributes to further define your condition [#attributes]

You can include a subset of incident event attributes in your title templates to add more context. 

Here's how:

* **Use the format `{{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}`**. For example:

    ```handlebars
    {{conditionName}} has triggered an incident
    ```
* **Tag attributes**: For tags, you would use the format `{{tag.TAG_NAME}}`.
 * **Facet clause tags**: If a NRQL condition uses a `FACET` clause, you can use `tag` formatting to use those values in your title template. For example, if the NRQL query included `FACET hostName, cluster`, you could then use this:

    ```handlebars
    Host {{tag.hostName}}, cluster {{tag.cluster}} incident
    ```

Keep in mind that tag names cannot contain spaces, but the expanded values can. For a full list of available attributes, see [Incident event attributes](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/understand-technical-concepts/incident-event-attributes)

## In the UI [#create-in-UI]

1. Navigate to the NRQL condition builder. For instructions, see [Alert conditions](docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/alert-conditions/).
1. Create your NRQL condition.
1. In the final step, Add details, enter your title template in the Title template field.
1. Save the condition.

## In GraphQL [#graphql]

In GrapQL, the title template field is called `titleTemplate`. Here's an example mutation to update a NRQL static condition to add a title template:

```graphql
mutation {
  alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(
    accountId: 123456
    id: 456789
    condition: {titleTemplate: "{{conditionName}} has triggered an incident"}
  ) {
    titleTemplate
  }
}
```
