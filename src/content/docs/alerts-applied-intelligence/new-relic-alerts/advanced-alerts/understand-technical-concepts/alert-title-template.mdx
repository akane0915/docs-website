A title template is used when incidents are opened by the condition. It overrides the default title.

## Why use a title template?
An alert condition is the foundation for incident creation. Whether you're using our guided mode or crafting a condition from a chart or policy, using a unique title template is the final step to creating an alert condition. While this is optional, we recommend it. An alert condition defines a set of thresholds you want to monitor. If any of those thresholds are breached, an incident is created. The title template will identify what specific threshold was breached within that condition. Meaningful title templates help you pinpoint issues and resolve outages faster.

## Before you begin [#begin]

Here are some key things to note before you use our title template: 

* **Compatibility**: The title template feature is available for NRQL conditions only.
* **Character limit**: The maximum length for a title template is 256 characters.
* **Formatting**: The title template must follow a valid [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) format. 
* **Lost signal incidents**: For incidents triggered by a lost signal, the default title will always be used. To learn more about signal loss, see [Loss of signal and gap filling](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-api-loss-signal-gap-filling/). 

## Use the title template[#example]

Let's say you run an e-commerce site and you have created an alert condition to trigger an incident whenever your site generates 404-response errors. You can use a title template to make incidents from this condition easily identifiable.

You have named this alert condition `high error rate - production`. But you want the incident title to reflect where the errors are being generated. In this case, the errors for this incident are in your checkout.

**Example**: 

```handlebars
{{conditionName}} targeting {{targetName}} incident
```

This template would generate the following incident title:

```
High error rate- production targeting `checkout` incident
```

## Use attributes to further define your condition [#attributes]

You can include a subset of incident event attributes in your title templates to add more context. 

Here's how:

* **Use the format `{{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}`**. For example:

    ```handlebars
    {{conditionName}} has triggered an incident
    ```
* **Tag attributes**: For tags, use the format `{{tag.TAG_NAME}}`.
 * **Facet clause tags**: If a NRQL condition uses a `FACET` clause, you can use `tag` formatting to use those values in your title template. For example, if the NRQL query included `FACET hostName, cluster`, you could then use this:

    ```handlebars
    Host {{tag.hostName}}, cluster {{tag.cluster}} incident
    ```

Tag names cannot contain spaces, but the expanded values can. For a full list of available attributes, see [Incident event attributes](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/understand-technical-concepts/incident-event-attributes).



## In the UI [#create-in-UI]

1. Navigate to the NRQL condition builder. For instructions, see [Alert conditions](docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/alert-conditions/).
1. Create your NRQL condition.
1. In the final step, Add details, enter your title template in the Title template field.
1. Save the condition.

## In GraphQL [#graphql]

In GraphQL, the title template field is called `titleTemplate`. Here's an example mutation to update a NRQL static condition to add a title template:

```graphql
mutation {
  alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(
    accountId: 123456
    id: 456789
    condition: {titleTemplate: "{{conditionName}} has triggered an incident"}
  ) {
    titleTemplate
  }
}
```
