title: Title template for NRQL Alert Conditions
---

For NRQL alert conditions, you can define a title template.

## What is a title template?

A title template is used when incidents are opened by the condition. It overrides the default title.

Note: For incidents opened by a lost signal, the default template will always be used.

## Requirements

* The title template feature is available for NRQL conditions only.
* Title template maximum character length is 256.
* Title template must be a valid [handlebars format](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/).

## Title template example

You must use handlebars formatting when using attributes in the title template field. For example:

```handlebars
{{conditionName}} targeting {{targetName}} incident
```

An incident resulting from this condition would be titled:

```
Error rate targeting prod-us-123 incident
```

## How to use attributes
The attributes you can use in a title template are a subset of attributes attached to the [incident event](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/understand-technical-concepts/incident-event-attributes). Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them:

* Use the format `{{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}`. For example:

  ```handlebars
  {{conditionName}} has triggered an incident
  ```
* Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format `{{tag.TAG_NAME}}`.

  * Facet clause tags: If a NRQL condition uses a `FACET` clause, you can use `tag` formatting to use those values in your title template. For example, if the NRQL query included `FACET hostName, cluster`, you could then use this:

    ```handlebars
    Host {{tag.hostName}}, cluster {{tag.cluster}} incident
    ```

Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves.


## Create a title template in the UI

1. From the NRQL condition builder form, follow the steps to create the NRQL condition.
2. On the last step, "Add details", type your title in the "Title template" field.
3. Save the condition.

## Create a title template in GraphQL

The title template field is called `titleTemplate` in GraphQL.

Here's an example mutation to update a NRQL static condition to add a title template:

```graphql
mutation {
  alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(
    accountId: 123456
    id: 456789
    condition: {titleTemplate: "{{conditionName}} has triggered an incident"}
  ) {
    titleTemplate
  }
}
```
