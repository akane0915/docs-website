title: Custom Incident Titles for NRQL Alert Conditions
---

For NRQL alert conditions, you can define a custom incident title. Custom incident title is also referred to as title template.

## What is a custom incident title?

A custom incident title is used when incidents are opened by the condition. It overrides the default incident title.

## Requirements

* The custom incident title feature is available for NRQL conditions only.
* Custom incident title maximum character length is 256.
* Custom incident title must be a valid handlebars format.

## Custom incident title example

You must use handlebars formatting when using attributes in the custom incident title field. For example:

```handlebars
{{conditionName}} targeting {{targetName}} incident
```

An incident resulting from this condition would be titled:

```
Error rate targeting prod-us-123 incident
```

## How to use attributes
The attributes you can use in a custom incident title are a subset of attributes attached to the [incident event](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/understand-technical-concepts/incident-event-attributes). Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them:

* Use the format `{{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}`. For example:

  ```handlebars
  {{conditionName}} has triggered an incident
  ```
* Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format `{{tag.TAG_NAME}}`.

  * Facet clause tags: If a NRQL condition uses a `FACET` clause, you can use `tag` formatting to use those values in your custom incident title. For example, if the NRQL query included `FACET hostName, cluster`, you could then use this:

    ```handlebars
    Host {{tag.hostName}}, cluster {{tag.cluster}} incident
    ```

Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves.


## Create a custom incident title in the UI

1. From the NRQL condition builder form, follow the steps to create the NRQL condition.
2. On the last step, "Add details", type your title in the "Custom incident title" field.
3. Save the condition.

## Create a custom incident title in GraphQL

The custom incident title field is called `titleTemplate` in GraphQL.

Here's an example mutation to update a NRQL static condition to add a custom incident title:

```graphql
mutation {
  alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(
    accountId: 123456
    id: 456789
    condition: {titleTemplate: "{{conditionName}} has triggered an incident"}
  ) {
    titleTemplate
  }
}
```
