New Relic CodeStream will notify you about comments, issues, and feedback requests that you follow, and you can choose whether you want to be notified via email, desktop (for the VS Code and JetBrains extensions only), or both. Look for the notifications option under your user profile menu at the top of the CodeStream pane.

## Notification settings [#settings]

By default, you're set to automatically follow any comment, issue, or feedback request that you created, where you’ve been mentioned (either in the original post or in a subsequent reply), or to which you’ve replied. 

You can always choose to follow or unfollow any individual comment, issue, or feedback request via its ellipses menu.

## Follow or unfollow [#follow]

Email notifications are sent immediately. You can participate in the discussion by replying to the email. Your reply will get added to CodeStream as a  reply to the appropriate comment, issue, or feedback request. Be sure that when you reply you're doing so from the same email address where the notification was sent (that is, your email address listed in **My Organization** on CodeStream).

## Desktop notifications [#desktop]

If you’re using CodeStream in VS Code or a JetBrains IDE you can also receive desktop notifications in the IDE for comment, issue, or feedback requests that you follow.

## Other notifications [#other]

CodeStream offers the following notifications that can be turned on and off via the checkboxes at the bottom of the page.

* **Notify me about outstanding feedback requests**: Get an email reminder about open feedback requests assigned to you that you haven't responded to in the last 24 hours.
* **Notify me about new unreviewed commits from teammates when I pull**: Any time you pull, if there are new commits from a teammate on the current branch you'll get a toast notification. Click the **Review** button to start reviewing your teammate's changes and provide feedback.
* **Send me weekly emails summarizing my activity**: Sent every Monday with information about you and your organization's activity for the previous week.

If you've connected to GitHub or GitHub Enterprise to leverage CodeStream's [pull request integration](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/pull-requests), you'll also be notified when a pull request is assigned to you or you are added as a reviewer.
