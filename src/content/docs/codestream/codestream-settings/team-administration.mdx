New Relic CodeStream provides several tools for managing the teammates in your organization, whether they have accounts with New Relic One or not.

In the header, click the **My Organization** menu button to manage your organization, invite people, and assign or remove admin privileges.

## Manage people and roles [#manage]

Admins are identified in the teammates list. If you're an admin, use the dropdown to assign or remove admin privileges to any member.

### Invite your teammates [#invite]

Click **Invite Teammates** to invite new members to your organization, see outstanding invites, and suggested teammates.

  * The outstanding invitations section lists all open invitations. The right side of each row has links to remove the invitation or to resend the invite.
  * Click **reinvite** to send another invitation via email. You can also hover over the reinvite link for the option to generate an email yourself.
  * The suggested teammates section, only available for admins, is a list of possible teammates derived from the commit history of your open repositories. At the right side of each row are links to remove the suggestion from the list or to invite the person.

### Blame map [#blame]

Click **Blame Map** to add email addresses that you use for committing code that may be different from the email address you used to sign up for CodeStream. For example, your CodeStream email address might be dave@acme.com, but you might also commit code as `dave@webmail.com`. 

Click **Add mapping**, enter your Git email address, and then select your entry from the list of organization members. That way, when someone comments on code committed by dave@webmail.com, CodeStream will know to at-mention you (such as, `dave@acme.com`).

While non-admins can only create blame maps for themselves, admins can create blame maps for any member of the organization. This is useful for reassigning code ownership when people leave the organization.

## Organization settings [#organization-settings]

If you're an admin, use the **Organization Admin** menu under the headshot menu at the top of the CodeStream pane to change your organization's name, manage [onboarding](#onboarding) and [feedback requests](#feedback-request) settings, [export data](#export), or delete your org.

### Onboarding settings [#onboarding]

Domain-based joining allows anyone with email addresses on the specified domains to join your CodeStream organization without being first invited. Not only does this make it very easy to get your teammates on board, but it ensures that they'll be part of your organization (as opposed to accidentally creating their own).

### Feedback request assignment and approval [#feedback-requests]

Admins can control how both feedback request assignments and approvals work for your organization.

<figcaption>Use the feedback request settings to fine tune your organization's feedback process.</figcaption>

By default, the person requesting feedback can decide how approvals work, but you can, instead, set a default behavior for all feedback requests for the organization.

* **Any reviewer can approve**: Anyone can approve the feedback request, regardless of how many reviewers are assigned.
* **All reviewers must approve individually**: Each assigned reviewer must individually approve the feedback request before it's considered approved.

You can also decide if and how CodeStream suggests reviewers. **Round-robin** will cycle through all developers in the organization. **Random** will randomly assign the feedback request to any developer in the organization. The **Authorship** options will suggest up to three reviewers based on the developers who wrote the lines of code impacted by the changes, as well as other developers who may have committed to the branch.

### Export your data [#export] 

There's a lightweight export tool for getting your organization's discussions out of CodeStream.
