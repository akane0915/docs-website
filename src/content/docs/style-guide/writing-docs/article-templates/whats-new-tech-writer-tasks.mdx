Technical writers play an important role in the publication of "What's new" posts. While our contributors follow [Instructions to create What's New posts](src/content/docs/style-guide/writing-docs/article-templates/whats-new-template.mdx), you will take some additional steps to help contributors finalize their work.

## An overview of the process [#overall-process]

A high-altitude view of the `What's new` process looks like this:

1. Anyone in the company can submit a `What's new` pull request (PR) to the docs website.
2. A number of product marketing managers are on rotation to review posts and make suggestions.
3. When the product marketing manager finishes reviewing the post, they insert a PR comment asking tech docs to do another review. 
4. The tech writer completes the review and either publishes the post, or puts a comment in the PR confirming that it's ready to be posted on a certain date and time window.

## Specific tech writer tasks for posts [#specific-writing-tasks]

Each day, the hero is responsible for checking the status of `What’s new` posts. The daily hero takes ownership of the post (reviewing, posting, and confirming posts make it to docs site and product UI). When the post comes in, only assign it to yourself if you're going to see it through from start to finish. Otherwise, you can just monitor it as it goes through the workflow. 

When product marketing managers finish reviewing the post and pass it to the hero, the hero should do the following:

* Insert the publishing date and time window into the PR title so it’s easy to recognize. Our [instructions](src/content/docs/style-guide/writing-docs/article-templates/whats-new-template.mdx) tell contributors that we offer these publishing windows: morning, mid-day, or evening. You may need to ask if they want this posted early to ensure it is available on time.
* If a post is contributed by one of the reviewers listed in [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS), it doesn't need a product marketing review. You can start the writing review right away.
* Review the doc using our main style guide rules. If you see major issues, work with the contributor (or the product marketing reviewer); otherwise, you can just make the changes yourself.
* Confirm that the URLs to the docs site are absolute (relative paths don't resolve in the product UI):
  ```
    * Absolute path (Good): [**Billing user role**](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#roles)
    * Relative path (Bad): [**Billing user role**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#roles)
  ```
* If the post refers to any images, make sure they are not links to images hosted on other sites. Images files must reside in our repository.
* Check if the post has the `isFeatured: true` in the front matter. If so, this means that the post will be pinned to the top of the product UI. You should remove the corresponding flag in the previously featured post so only one post is featured.
* After you publish the post, confirm that it shows up in both the docs site and in the product UI.
* For posts that are to be published in the future:
  * Generally, the hero on duty takes responsibility for the post on the day it needs to be published. 
  * If a post needs to go out earlier than the typical 8 or 9 a.m. (US pacific) merge, the hero who worked on this initially should arrange to have this posted.
  * In some cases, such as for specific high-visibility releases, a technical writer may take ownership of the posting by assigning themselves to the PR so everyone can see that the hero isn’t responsible for that post.
