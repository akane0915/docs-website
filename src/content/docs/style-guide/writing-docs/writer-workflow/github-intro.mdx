Tech doc writers (TW) are responsible for the docs. We [write and edit the docs](/docs/style-guide/writer-workflow/tech-writer-workflow/) and [exchange peer edits](/docs/style-guide/writer-workflow/peer-editor-workflow/), maintain our backlog, and `hero`. To make it all happen, we use our [Docs Team GitHub board](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website) to manage filed issues and pull requests (PRs).

## The who's who of an issue or PR [#who-is-who]
GitHub tracks every stage of an issue or pull request's life cycle, including the people moving things along.

Because the Docs team invite anyone to file an issue or create a pull request through GitHub, we strongly recommend verifying a filer's relationship to the New Relic GitHub organization. If you're uncertain if a contributor is a Relic, a good trick is to check if they're a member of the New Relic GitHub org. Generally, we recommend assuming a filer is external until proven otherwise.

Who's who of an issue or PR:

* **Creator**: Opens the issue or PR. The creator could be someone on the Docs team, another Relic, or an external user. You'll label the issue or PR differently depending on who created it.
* **Assignee**: Takes responsibility for an issue or PR. The Hero or Sidekick will assign non-TW issues and PRs to themselves, or they can take over an issue or PR from another writer. The Hero or sidekick will assign non-TW issues and PRs to themselves, or they can take over an issue or PR from another writer.
* **Reviewer**: Peer edits the code or document, then approves the changes. Not necessarily the person responsible for that area or responsible for merging the commit. You can pre-assign up to 100 reviewers to a given issue.

## Track issues in the board [#github-board] 
The docs board has the following columns:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        Column
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Needs triage**
      </td>
      <td>
        The Hero or Sidekick **review and [label](#labels)** issues and PRs in this column, then drag them to the appropriate column.

        If a PR or issue is labeled `eng`, the Hero/Sidekick can go ahead and click its ellipses icon to archive it. 
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Hero: to do**
      </td>
      <td>
        PRs that the Hero needs to review, publish, and  follow up with SMEs as needed.  
        
        **Hero: Assign yourself as Assignee**.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **In review (Hero or any TW)**
      </td>
      <td>
        Drag PRs to this column when they are being reviewed. This shows who is reviewing and what is being reviewed, so two writers don’t mistakenly work on the same PR.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Any TW: Writer needs PR review**
      </td>
      <td>
        PRs from Tech Docs team members that need a light edit pass to make sure everything in GitHub is correct. This should be checked by other writers every few hours so PRs don’t get stale. 
        
        If you have a PR that’s been lingering here too long, ask for a reviewer in #doc_sprint_talk. 
        
        **Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer.**
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Any TW: needs peer edit**
      </td>
      <td>
        Like our Needs Peer Edit column in Jira: A writer has requested a review of their PR. Review their PR in GitHub and leave comments. 
        
        **Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer.**
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Waiting on SME/Blocked**
      </td>
      <td>
        For PRs that are blocked by need for SME info or confirmation (for example, as Hero you are waiting on an answer from the person who sent in a Hero pull request).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Waiting on TW to merge**
      </td>
      <td>
        All reviews are complete. The TW who created the PR (or who is assigned the issue) needs to merge this work into develop.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Drafts**
      </td>
      <td>
        A draft is a way to open a PR while indicating that the work is still in progress and not necessarily ready to merge immediately. You can't merge a Draft PR directly. Instead, you must move it out of draft status first.
        
        When you see a draft PR (especially from outside the team!), treat it as though it's a working draft, and reach out to the creator to discuss.

</table>

As a **Hero**, make sure you attend to the following throughout your day:
* Check in with the previous Hero at the start of your day (especially on Monday at the start of the week). Don’t forget to sync with the BCN Hero if necessary.
* Watch for incoming PRs in #docs_deploys, and review everything in the Needs triage column. Drag cards from that column to the appropriate column.
* Work through the cards in the  Hero: to do column.

**Everyone on the team** helps keep things moving:
* All writers should keep an eye on both Any TW columns. 
* There's one column for PRs that need a simpler review before merging (typo fixes, drive-by edits, etc), and another column for PRs that need a peer edit.
* There are also two blocked columns: One for PRs blocked on a SME, and another column where we're waiting on the TW who created the PR to review feedback and/or merge.
* After merging, remove your ticket from the board.

## Deal with references in GitHub (and the style guide) [#references]
* Don't link to anything non-public from a public place.
* You can reference Jira tickets, but reference tickets by issue key (`DOC-1234` is ok) rather than a link (`https://newrelic.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1234` is not).
* Don't mention traffic or usage numbers publicly.
* Don't reference internal people by name. If they have a GH account, @mention their GH handle. If they don't, talk instead about teams ("talk to a browser team engineer" or "Support Engineer") rather than people.
* You can mention the #documentation channel and hero.

## Merge releases into main work (or, when do we publish?) [#merging-main]
The Hero currently merges at 9 AM (morning), 12 PM (noon), and 3 PM (evening) Pacific. We merge release branches into main to avoid interuptions when someone merges into develop during a release. To learn more about this workflow, see the [gitflow documentation in Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

It's important to create a new release branch off of the develop branch. Before you create a new branch, make sure you're on develop.

To start a release:

1. Create a branch of `develop` using Github Desktop by clicking **Current Branch** in the top header, **New Branch** in the dropdown, then selecting **Develop**.
2. Name the branch with this pattern: `daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning/noon/evening`. For example, a daily release happening at 9am on October 27, 2021 would follow this style: `daily-release/10-27-21-morning`.
3. To push your changes, in GitHub Desktop click **Push Origin**. 
4. Create a pull request into main from your new daily release branch by clicking **Create Pull Request**. This will open a pull request screen on [github.com](github.com). Pull requests default to merging into develop, so select main as the `base` branch in the left side of the page and then click `Submit Pull Request`.
5. Wait until all the checks complete, and then merge the pull request.

All branches that follow the `daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning` pattern are [protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches). Only admins can delete them.

## GitHub labels [#labels]

We apply labels to issues so we can better triage and track the health of our backlog:

- `content`: All issues use this label. `content` indicates the issue is content-related rather than a design or engineering issue.
- `pg_*`: Docs team will always use this label to indicate product group. For full definitions, see the "Doc Jira and GitHub fields" doc in the internal team Google Drive.
- Indicate who created the issue:
  - `from_internal`: A Relic created it.
  - `from_external`: A non-Relic opened the issue in the repo OR the issue came in through #customer-feedback process.
  - `from_tw`: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback).
- Optionally:
  - `docs-issue-candidate`: Issues that are too large in scope for the docs team to handle without product team expertise. This label alerts the docs issues team to migrate these issues into the customer feedback channel where they will be triaged and sent to product teams. 
  - `Jira’d`: Issues that have a corresponding Jira ticket. Make sure you leave the Jira number in the comments of the issue (for example, DOC-1234).

Every pull request needs these labels so we can see where our contributions come from:

- `content`: Always add, this indicates the PR is content-related rather than design or engineering.
- Indicate who created the pull request:
  - `from_internal`: A Relic created it.
  - `from_external`: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process.
  - `from_tw`: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). If the PR fixes an external issue, label it as `from_tw` since the work was done by a tech writer.

## Docs issues [#docs-issues]

There's no hard and fast rule in choosing good candidates for docs issues. They could be anything too difficult for a docs hero to chase down, or anything that could benefit from deep engineering expertise. Some examples are code examples, requirements sections, and NRQL queries.

Ultimately, docs issues helps the docs team collaborate with product teams to solve documentation and product issues. It lets us leverage product team expertise to solve as many issues as we can, regarldess of who filed them.

The life cycle of a viable issues candidate looks something like this:

1. Someone files an issue through GitHub for the GitHub hero to evaluate it as a potential candidate. 
2. The hero adds the `docs-issue-candidate` label.
3. Every week, a designated docs team member assesses all issues with the `docs-issue-candidate` label.
4. If approved, the `docs-issue-candidate` label is changed to a `docs-issue` label. We then migrate the issue into the customer feedback Jira project.
5. The new jiras are triaged by PMs, then funneled to the correct project team.
6. The PM will give the ticket to an assignee, who will close it once complete.
